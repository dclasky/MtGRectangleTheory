# MtGRectangleTheory

Tokens are a design space that's been growing in MtG
Recently, "Rectangle Theory" has cropped up, it's the idea that token, which are permanents but not cards, contribute to a card-advantage-like benefit
This analysis assignes each card a "rectangle value" based on its card type, and any amount of tokens it creates. 

Note: this doesn't account for cards that make X tokens, like "Song of Totentanz", which are powerful, but rare.
